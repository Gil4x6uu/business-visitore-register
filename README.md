## About the project.
 I wanted to write a full stack project for my resume.
 
 The idea came while COVID-19 quarantine was about to end, the government released a note that all businesses need to log all customers visit their business.
 
The other day, while waiting to enter a store I realize the need for queue monitor   customers waiting outside a store, Can help avoid arguments :) 

##### The idea is simple:
- Store owners log in with google and create a store.

- Each store gets a unique id.

- Customers register to store by store unique id and then fill a short registration form.

- The store owner has a dashboard with an editable log and a Track of the queue outside.
